# background
The objective of this project is to analyze work in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãtechnology, especially data analysis.
### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were
1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysis?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used
for this analysis i used:

- **SQL**: The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgresSQL**: chosen this time, it was ideal for handling the job posting data
- **Docker**: Used to up the postgresSQL container
- **DBeaver**: The way to executing SQL queries more conveniently and quickly

# The Analysis
Each query aimed to investigate specific aspects of the data analysts' job market.
